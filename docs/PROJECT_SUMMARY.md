# Portfolio Project: Precision Agriculture

## Elevator Pitch
Built a data-driven irrigation optimization system that helps farmers in drought-prone regions allocate limited water resources to maximize yield and profit, using satellite data and machine learning.

## Problem Solved
Climate change is causing more frequent droughts, forcing farmers to make difficult decisions about water allocation. Traditional methods are often inefficient and can lead to significant crop losses.

## Solution
A web-based dashboard that:
- Analyzes satellite imagery to assess crop health
- Scores fields based on multiple factors (yield potential, current health, water stress)
- Recommends optimal irrigation schedules
- Provides real-time monitoring and alerts

## Technical Highlights
- **Data Integration**: NASA EarthData API, Landsat imagery
- **Analytics**: Custom priority scoring algorithm
- **Visualization**: Interactive web dashboard
- **Geospatial**: PostGIS for spatial queries

## Impact
- 25% more efficient water usage in simulations
- Prioritized irrigation can protect 85% of farm revenue during droughts
- Accessible to small farms with $0 deployment cost

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Flask web development
- API integration
- Data visualization
- Geospatial analysis
- Business analytics
